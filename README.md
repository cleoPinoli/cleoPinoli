- 👋 Hi, I’m @cleoPinoli; I (somehow) obtained a Bachelor Degree in CS, and (for some reason) decided to specialize in CyberSecurity.
- 📖 I’m trying to grasp concepts of: ToC, Internet and the plethora of its protocols, formal verification and model checking
- 🌱 My current focus is on Python programming (mostly for ethical hacking purposes), and basic concepts of Agda.
