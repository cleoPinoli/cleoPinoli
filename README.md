- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cleoPinoli; I (somehow) obtained a Bachelor Diploma in CompSci, and (for some reason) decided to major in CyberSecurity. Or CyberInsecurity, as I like to call it.
- ðŸ“– My studies mostly focus on: ToC, Internet and the plethora of its protocols, formal verification and model checking
- ðŸŒ± My current focus is on mechanisation of session-typed process calculi in Agda, I am somewhat familiar with Python, C and Java too. My guilty pleasure would be becoming fluent in Assembly. There will also be some C# in the foreseeable future. Alas.
