- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cleoPinoli; I (somehow) obtained a Bachelor Degree in CS, and (for some reason) decided to specialize in CyberSecurity.
- ðŸ“– I enjoy spending a considerable amount of my energy trying to grasp concepts of: ToC, Assembly code, the whole Internet absurdity and the plethora of its protocols, compilers, binary analysis, OSINT & ethical hacking in general.
- ðŸŒ± My current focus is on Python programming (mostly for ethical hacking purposes), and basic concepts of Agda.
