- 👋 Hi, I’m @cleoPinoli; I (somehow) obtained a Bachelor Diploma in CompSci, and decided to major in CyberSecurity. Or CyberInsecurity, as I like to call it. I am driven by the idea of Defense and Cyberdefense, despite being painfully aware of how challenging the discipline is. "Who are we, if we can't protect them?"
- 📖 My studies mostly focus on: ToC, Internet and the plethora of its protocols, formal verification and model checking
- 🌱 My current focus is on mechanisation of session-typed process calculi in Agda, I am somewhat familiar with Python, C and Java too. I have also chewed on a bit of C# for small Uni projects, but that wasn't much to my joy and happiness. My guilty pleasure would be being able to speak Assembly;
- 💡My personal interests and hobbies include: playing the guitar and creating questionable mash-ups, cooking and baking for my loved ones, playing videogames, doing some sport, and more;   
- ☄ In the near future, I'd like to... Get language-certified (I'm currently aiming for a C2 in English and a B1 in German) and get some cool IT certifications such as CompTIA and CCNA too. I was recently offered a position at Spike Reply in Milan, where I will be working with Identity and Access Management technologies. Exciting!
