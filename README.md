- 👋 Hi, I’m @cleoPinoli; I obtained a Bachelor Diploma in CompSci and majored in CyberSecurity. Or CyberInsecurity, as I like to call it.
- 📖 My master studies mostly focused on: ToC, networking, the Internet and its protocols, formal models and mechanised meta-theory 
- 🌱 My current focus is on mechanisation of session-typed process calculi in Agda, and I am somewhat familiar with Python, C and Java. I have also chewed on a bit of C# for small Uni projects;
