- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cleoPinoli; I (somehow) obtained a Bachelor Diploma in CompSci, and (for some reason) decided to major in CyberSecurity. Or CyberInsecurity, as I like to call it.
- ðŸ“– My studies mostly focus on: ToC, Internet and the plethora of its protocols, formal verification and model checking
- ðŸŒ± My current focus is on mechanisation of type systems in Agda, I am somewhat familiar with Python and Java too. There will also be some JavaScript and C# in the foreseeable future. Alas.
